## Installation
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kardchcode/MinishUI/releases/latest)
- Extract it to `/.simplemenu/themes/640x480/`
- Open the SimpleMenu settings and choose *MinishUI* there
- Done!
  
## Disclaimer
Only for **640x480** resolution devices, also, the theme is *atm* limited to a certain selection of consoles/systems, those being:

**`zx-spectrum, gba, gbc, gb, playstation, snes, nes, cps1 & MAME`**

In order for the theme to **fully** work you **MUST** only store games for these consoles/systems (you can leave the MAME, zx-spectrum & cps1 folders empty tho). If a mentioned game section (except the three I mentioned) does not contain any game at all the UI will be messed up! Apart from that you should be able to browse your sections just fine (but not with the MinUI fancy-style tho).
